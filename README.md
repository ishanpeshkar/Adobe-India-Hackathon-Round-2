## 🌟 Project Overview

Welcome to **PDF Insight Extractor**, our innovative solution for the *"Connecting the Dots"* hackathon challenge! This tool transforms static PDFs into intelligent, structured documents by:

- 🔍 **Automatically extracting** titles and hierarchical headings (H1-H3)
- 🧠 **Understanding document structure** like a human would
- 🚀 **Delivering JSON output** ready for interactive applications

Built with cutting-edge techniques and packaged for seamless deployment, our solution bridges the gap between documents and machine understanding.

## 🏆 Challenge Context

> *"What if every time you opened a PDF, it didn't just sit there—it spoke to you, connected ideas, and narrated meaning across your entire library?"*

Our mission: **Reimagine PDFs as intelligent, interactive experiences** that understand structure and surface insights.
